We’ll expose database data, and then look at how to work with subscriptions and queries. Then, we dive into the options for templating, with a look at dynamic Blaze templates and the Spacebars templating language. You’ll learn event handling and then test our application using Cucumber and Jasmine. After that, we deploy our application locally on the Meteor server, and then to Amazon to set it up for frequent updates and hot code deployment.

The birth of CSS3 brings with it many updates that make designing in HTML easier and more stunning. </p><p>Web Visualization with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript is a comprehensive video course that covers everything you need to know about the cutting-edge techniques introduced in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. </p><p>The course starts off by getting you up to date with the most recent advancements in CSS3 visualization techniques. From there you’ll keep building your knowledge base by shifting your focus to animating and transforming elements without JavaScript using CSS. Moving ahead, you’ll discover how to draw in SVG and animate these elements without the use of JavaScript. Then, we’ll change gears to cover bitmap/raster art as you learn to draw in HTML5 Canvas and how to animate the drawn elements. We’ll wind up the course with a foray into animation libraries and pure JavaScript animations.</p><p>By the end of the course, you will be fully armed to create stunning web visualizations to integrate it into your workflow.</p></span></span>","isbn":"9781785880971","format":"video","date_added":"2015-11-25T17:00:06.344Z","archive_id":"9781785880971","authors":["Ben Fhala"],"number_of_reviews":0,"id":"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/api/v1/book/9781785880971/","popularity":1378,"cover_url":"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/cover/9781785880971/","issued":"2015-11-23T00:00:00Z"},{"timestamp":"2016-07-06T12:22:55.632Z","average_rating":0,"web_url":"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-javascript-data/9781782175698/","title":"Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms","duration_seconds":4993,"virtual_pages":0,"source":"application/epub+zip","publishers":["Packt Publishing"],"url":"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/api/v1/book/9781782175698/","content_type":"book","description":"<span><span><p>Find out how data structures and algorithms can be used to solve programming problems using JavaScript</p><p><b>About This Video</b></p><li><p>Discover how to implement complex data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs, and trees using vanilla JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Get a good understanding of basic and advanced structures and algorithms</p></li><li><p>Master new and upcoming native data structures in ES6 and ES7</p></li><li><p>Understand algorithm analysis and implementation to resolve common programming problems</p></li><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>As businesses collect increasing amounts of vital data, the need to structure software components increases every day. Using appropriate data structures and having a good understanding of algorithm analysis is key to writing maintainable and extensible quality software, thus solving the crisis.</p><p>Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms will show you how to organize your code with the most appropriate data structures available to get the job done fast, and in a logical way that is easy to maintain, refactor, and test. By using effective data structures, you can take advantage of advanced algorithms, thus making your web applications more powerful and scalable. You will learn about common software engineering data structures, such as linked-lists, trees, and graphs, and get to know how to implement them in JavaScript. You’ll also master ways to use them in various types of algorithms.</p><p>You will begin by finding out how to build on native JavaScript constructs, and create collections such as maps, queues, stacks, sets, graphs, and other data structures. You will then discover how to develop, analyze, and improve algorithms to search deep trees, lists, and other complex collections, as well as sorting containers of data.</p><p>This practical course will guide you through a web application development cycle using a structured and disciplined approach, focusing on accuracy and efficiency as you build quality software.</p></span></span>","isbn":"9781782175698","format":"video","date_added":"2015-11-04T17:00:17.419Z","archive_id":"9781782175698","authors":["Rodrigo Formigone Silveira"],"number_of_reviews":0,"id":"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/api/v1/book/9781782175698/","popularity":1359,"cover_url":"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/cover/9781782175698/","issued":"2015-10-30T00:00:00Z"}],"page":6,"total":14939,"facets":{"facet_intervals":{},"facet_fields":{"format":["book",14413,"video",526],"publishers_exact":["A Book Apart",11,"A K Peters/CRC Press",10,"AMACOM",27,"AVA Publishing",1,"Academic Press",36,"Adams Media",16,"Addison-Wesley",11,"Addison-Wesley Professional",795,"Adobe Press",118,"Alpha",13,"American Society for Training & Development",8,"Apress",933,"Artima Press",6,"Association for Talent Development",2,"Auerbach Publications",15,"Axzo Press",2,"BCS Learning & Development Limited",7,"Basic Books",7,"Ben Watson",1,"BenBella Books",5,"Berrett-Koehler Publishers",18,"Bibliomotion",1,"Big Nerd Ranch Guides",10,"Bleeding Edge Press",15,"Brainy Software",31,"British Informatics Society Limited",9,"Business Expert Press",19,"Butterworth-Heinemann",8,"CRC Press",22,"Cambridge University Press",64,"Capstone",6,"Career Press",3,"Cengage Learning",1,"Cengage Learning PTR",4,"Center for Creative Leadership",1,"Center for Cryptologic History, NSA",1,"Chandos Publishing",9,"Chapman and Hall/CRC",19,"Cisco Press",181,"Coffing Publishing",3,"Context-Driven Press",2,"Course Technology PTR",203,"DK Eyewitness Travel",3,"DK Publishing",1,"Da Capo Press",4,"David & Charles",1,"De Gruyter Oldenbourg",1,"Digital Press",6,"Diversion Books",4,"Edward Elgar Publishing",2,"Elsevier",8,"Elsevier Science",210,"Essvale",12,"FT Press",69,"FT Publishing International",1,"Focal Press",149,"For Dummies",257,"Frontend Masters",18,"Gilbane Group, Inc.",4,"Gulf Professional Publishing",1,"HOW Books",6,"HRD Press",1,"HarperCollins",4,"Harriman House",3,"Harvard Business Review Press",25,"IBM Press",69,"IBM Redbooks",399,"IGI Global",1437,"IT Governance Ltd",19,"IT Revolution Press",1,"IconLogic, Inc.",9,"Infinite Ideas",3,"Infinite Skills",81,"InformIT",1,"J.
