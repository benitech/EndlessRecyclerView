The video provides simple styling\nand layout guidelines to work in both browser and mobile devices. \n<br/><br/>Lesson 4, “Saving JSON Created by AngularJS to MongoDB,”\ntakes all the pieces already in place and uses the AngularJS\nngResource module to post JSON to the Java server-side resource.\nThe video also shows how to create the server-side Java code that\nreceives and saves JSON to the MongoDB database. \n<br/><br/>Lesson 5, “Managing Server-Side Resources Using Dropwizard,”\nuses Dropwizard to manage the lifecycle of resources. Developers\nlearn how to use this to clean up connections to the database. \n<br/><br/>Lesson 6, “Using UI Bootstrap Widgets,” covers showing\nfeedback to the user with UI Bootstrap components. The video also\nhighlights how to create an alert after successfully saving an\norder while using minimal code. \n<br/><br/>Lesson 7, “Taking Advantage of MongoDB’s Dynamic Schema,”\nshows how to use another UI Bootstrap widget to create a typeahead\nfield, a form field that helps the users by suggesting terms as\nthey type.
