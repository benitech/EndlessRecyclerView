He then takes a brief, but necessary, detour to introduce\nScalable Vector Graphics (SVG)—a standard for rendering graphical\nelements on the web that D3 works particularly well with. From\nthere, he walks through how to construct an interactive bar chart,\nrendered in SVG, but built entirely with D3, starting with very\nbasic D3 concepts and adding more and more sophistication, lesson\nby lesson. Finally, he covers how to strike out on your own. After\nwatching this video, designers and developers will feel comfortable\ndiving right in to D3 and telling elegant visual stories with web\ngraphics.</p><p><b>About the Instructor</b></p><p><b>Ritchie S.
